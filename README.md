This is my second React project)

!!!DESCRIPTION!!!

There are four pages: Home / Products / Services / SingUp / PageNotFound;

In addition, I wrote six components such as: Button, Cards, CardItem, HeroSection, Navbar and Loader.

Technologies I used: Html, Css, Js, React(react, react-router-dom);
I also used the Font Awesome library - a library of web icons and tools.

----------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------
Planning to improve the project in the future

Add code styles and functionality for the Products / Services / SingUp pages.

I also plan to use React Hooks and Redux Toolkit;
